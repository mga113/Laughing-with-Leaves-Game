# Game Name: Laughing with Leaves 

## Project Description
This is a riddle game, where the user solves various leaf-like riddles in order to grow a tree. The more riddles the user sucessfully answers,
 the more the tree grows. If you reach max tree size, you have sucessfully grown the tree and you win the game!
 
 On the contrary, for every riddle answered incorrecrtly, the tree's growth process is reversed, and it is 
shrivels. If you reach the minimum tree size, the tree is shriveled and you loose the game.

## Ties to the theme
This idea incorpeartes both the tangible and in-tangible interpretations of the theme "turning a new leaf."
This game literally incorperates various different aspects of leaves by creating witty leaf riddles. They are humourous and can be a great
stress buster game. Helping you improve your overall well-being and turn a new leaf in life.
